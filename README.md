# docker-django-drw-react-tsx-rust-webgl

A slightly opinionated local dev full stack template using docker-compose with Django backend and React frontend; all served behind NGINX. Keeping the full stack in one repo for ease of use. Composed of ideas from multiple tutorials, forum threads and official docs. Nothing original here.

## Main Frameworks/Libraries/Packages

Please see requirements.txt, package.json, Cargo.toml for full details.

Django

- Django v3 series
- Django Rest Framework
- Django Rest Framework Simple JWT
- PyTest

React

- Create React App
- Node dev server via Docker LTS alpine image
- Hot reload
- TypeScript/ESlint with very opinionated rules
- SASS support
- WebAssembly support
- Integration with the Rust-Wasm module

Postgress

- Docker v12.0 alpine image

Ngnix

- Docker stable alpine
- See conf for details. Serves Django's static and media files as well.

Rust

- Compilation on code change straight to WASM with all type definitions
- Rust 2018 edition
- wasm-bindgen for WEB APIs

## Notes

Django

- One app created/installed called core
- Custom user stubbed out in the Core app. No additional fields. Just a blank class that inherets AbstractUser. core.User is assigned as AUTH_USER_MODEL
- SimpleJWT is installed but not used.

React

- To mark a css file as a module use the syntax of `import style from "styleFile.module.scss"`

### Useful Commands

Build containers. Add -up flag to bring services up after build.

```sh

$> docker-compose build

```

Bring containers up. Add -d flag to run output detached from current shell.

```sh

$> docker-compose up

```

Bring containers down. Add -v flag to also delete named volumes

```sh

$> docker-compose down

```

View logs by service name.

```sh

$> docker-compose logs <service-name>

```

Enter shell for specified container (must be running)

```sh

$> docker exec -it <container-name> sh

```

### Containers, Services and Ports

| Container  | Service | Host Port | Docker Port |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| dev-django | django  | 8001      | 8000        |
| dev-react  | react   | 3001      | 3000        |
| dev-db     | db      | 5432      | 5432        |
| dev-nginx  | nginx   | 8080      | 80          |
| dev-rust   | rust    |           |             |

### Why NGINX for local dev

Please make all requests from your browser through http://localhost:8080 and
NGINX will happily redirect the request and proxy all your services so your
browser thinks it's all one and the same protocol/domain/port == CORS bliss.
